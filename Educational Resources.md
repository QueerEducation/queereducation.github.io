<a href="https://www.glsen.org/" target="_blank">GLSEN</a> provides free lesson plans, activities, and other resources for educators. These lessons are comprised of knowledge and skills that help students navigate a diverse world and foster a positive environment in schools. All of their lessons are age appropriate and align with the Common Core ELA Standards.

<a href="https://rainbowlibrary.org/" target="_blank">The Rainbow Library</a> is a completely free program that sends LBTQIA+ texts to schools across America for free! Any full-time staff member at a K-12 school in a participating state or county is welcome to request a Rainbow Library. All types of K-12 schools are eligible: district, magnet, charter, and independent. Each school that applies will be eligible for one Rainbow Library text set, and sets are provided on a first-come, first served basis. Founded 25 years ago, GLSEN is the leading national education organization focused on ensuring safe and affirming schools for LGBTQ students. GLSEN has volunteer-run chapters in 31 states.
