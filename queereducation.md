# What does queer education look like? 
“Can you imagine you’re a parent and your son leaves the house and you say, ‘Jimmy, I love you so much, go have a good day in school,’ and your son comes back with a brutal operation?" That is a direct quote from Donald Trump during a rally in Wisconsin during the 2024 presidential elections, but is it true, what are schools teaching children about gender and sexuality? 
	Organization such as GLSEN (Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network) provide age appropriate lessons for each age. Early elementary lessons focus on exploring inclusionary and exclusionary language, different family structures, and harmful gender stereotypes. Teachers are never giving sex ed lessons but often will read books in the classroom that contain characters with two of the same sex parent or explain gender identity on a basic level. There is no record of any school or individual educator with an idea such as teaching children about gender reassignment surgeries, let alone preforming them. The common factor in all these lessons is acceptance and that it is okay to be yourself, even if that means Jimmy wants to wear pink instead of blue. 
Many believe that there is no point in educating students at any age about sexuality and gender. They may ask why five year old Jimmy need to know that gay people exist or transgender individuals, but what happens when he finds out they exist or that he is different than everyone else around him? 	How easy is it for someone to change their entire mindset, let alone a child. How will his mental health be impacted if he finds out he is different than everyone else and can't put words to it?
